i want to keep my github bio i am ai machine learning engineer etc i a having hand on experinec in rag deep learing models as well giv eme bio
ChatGPT said:
Sure, Vijay 👍
Here are clean, professional GitHub bio options you can directly copy-paste. I’m giving multiple styles so you can choose what fits you best.

🔹 Short & Crisp (Most Popular for GitHub)
AI & Machine Learning Engineer
Working on Deep Learning, RAG systems, and LLM-based applications.
Hands-on experience in model training, embeddings, vector search, and deployment.
Passionate about building scalable, real-world AI solutions.

🔹 Technical & Strong (Recruiter-Friendly)
AI / Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience in Deep Learning, RAG pipelines, and LLM-powered systems.
Skilled in embeddings, vector databases, transformers, model optimization, and end-to-end ML workflows.
Actively building and experimenting with production-ready AI systems.

🔹 Slightly Personal + Technical
AI & ML Engineer focused on Deep Learning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
I enjoy designing efficient ML pipelines, training models, and integrating LLMs with real data.
Always learning, building, and optimizing 🚀

🔹 Ultra-Compact (Minimalist)
AI & ML Engineer | Deep Learning | RAG | LLMs
Building intelligent systems with real-world impact.

🔹 If you want emoji style (GitHub-friendly, not too flashy)
🤖 AI & Machine Learning Engineer
🔍 RAG • Deep Learning • LLMs
🧠 Embeddings • Vector Search • Model Training
🚀 Building production-ready AI systems

✅ My Recommendation for You
Given your RAG, embeddings (BioBERT), LLM, and deep learning work, I’d personally suggest Option 2 or Option 5.

If you want, I can:

Tailor it exactly for jobs / internships / research

Add tech stack keywords (PyTorch, LangChain, LlamaIndex, FAISS, etc.)

Make it sound more senior or more student-friendly

Just tell me 👍

how can i chenage muy github username
ChatGPT said:
You can change your GitHub username easily. Follow these safe step-by-step instructions, Vijay 👇

✅ How to Change Your GitHub Username
1️⃣ Go to GitHub Settings
Log in to GitHub

Click your profile photo (top-right)

Select Settings

2️⃣ Open Account Settings
In the left sidebar, click Account

3️⃣ Change Username
Find Change username

Click Edit

Enter your new desired username

GitHub will check availability

Click Save

⚠️ Important Things You MUST Know (Very Important)
🔹 Repositories & Links
GitHub automatically redirects old repo URLs to the new username ✅

Example:
github.com/oldname/project → redirects to → github.com/newname/project

🔹 Git Remotes (Recommended Fix)
Your local repos may still point to the old username.

Run this in each project:

git remote -v
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/NEW_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
🔹 GitHub Pages
If you use GitHub Pages:

You may need to update the Pages source

Custom domains may need reconfiguration

🔹 Mentions & API Tokens
@oldusername mentions will not redirect

OAuth apps, CI/CD secrets usually remain OK, but verify

🧠 Best Practices for Choosing a New Username
Since you’re into AI / ML / RAG, consider:

vijay-ai

vijay-ml

vijay-rag

vijay-llm

vijay-dl

vijayxai

(avoid numbers & underscores if possible)

❗ Before You Change (Checklist)
✅ Update LinkedIn / Resume
✅ Update portfolio or README links
✅ Check local git remotes
✅ Inform collaborators if any

If you want, tell me:

Your current username

What style you want (professional / cool / minimal)

I’ll help you pick the best available GitHub username 🔥

You said:
what will i keep as username of github
ChatGPT said:
Good question, Vijay — this matters more than people think 👍
Let’s pick something professional, future-proof, and AI-focused.

🎯 Best Principles for a GitHub Username
Your username should be:

✅ Professional (works for jobs & research)

✅ Easy to remember & type

✅ Timeless (won’t feel outdated)

❌ Not too gimmicky

❌ Not tied to a single trend

🥇 Strong Recommendations (Top Picks)
⭐ Best Overall (Highly Recommended)
vijay-ai
✔ Clean
✔ Professional
✔ Perfect for AI/ML career
✔ Looks great on resumes & LinkedIn

⭐ More Technical / ML-Oriented
vijay-ml
vijay-dl
vijay-llm
Good if you want your focus very clear.

⭐ RAG / Research-Oriented
vijay-rag
vijay-nlp
vijay-ai-research
Best if you plan to publish, research, or do heavy NLP work.

⭐ Personal Brand (Most Future-Proof)
vijayx
vijay-ai-labs
vijaycodes
These still work even if your tech focus evolves.

🚫 Usernames I’d Avoid
vijay123
ai_vijay
vijay_007
darkvijay
mlhacker
They look less professional on resumes.

🧠 My Final Advice for YOU
Based on your:

AI + ML + RAG focus

Desire to grow professionally

GitHub being part of your portfolio

👉 Go with:

🥇 vijay-ai
If that’s taken, fallback in this order:

vijay-ml
vijay-llm
vijayxai
vijay-ai-labs
If you want, tell me:

Which ones are available

Or your real name initials
